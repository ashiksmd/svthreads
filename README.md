Filter author posts in forum threads into single html file

1. Host the flask application on a server or run svthreads.py for standalone test server.
2. Make sure the user running the server has permissions to edit the directory books.
3. Edit userscripts/SVThreads.js and update the value of serverURL and install the file in greasemonkey or tampermonkey.

If you only need the filter author posts feature, you can use the file
userscripts/SVFilterAuthorPosts.js instead.
